# Iris-Flowers-Classification

Data Description :
Attribute Information:
   1. sepal length in cm
   2. sepal width in cm
   3. petal length in cm
   4. petal width in cm
   5. class: 
      I.    Iris Setosa
      II.   Iris Versicolour
      III.  Iris Virginica
      
Basic Data Analysis :
1.  The dataset provided has 150 rows
2.  Dependent Variables : Sepal length.Sepal Width,Petal length,Petal Width
3.  Independent/Target Variable : Class
4.  Missing values : None      

Splitting the Dataset:
The dataset is divided into Train and Test data with 67:33 split ratio where 67% data is training data where as 33% data is test data.

Building the Models:
5 models are build using the training data and tested on the test data.The following models are used:-
I.    Random Forest
II.   Support Vector Machine
III.  Logistic Regression
IV.   K Nearest Neighbours
V.    Naive Bayes

Result:
On Running the following we get the following accuracies:-
I.    Random Forest: 0.94
II.   Support Vector Machine: 0.96
III.  Logistic Regression: 0.84
IV.   K Nearest Neighbours: 0.96
V.    Naive Bayes: 0.96

So , we can observe that the models Support Vector Machine,K Nearest Neighbours,Naive Bayes have the same accuracy 0.96 (i.e 96%).
